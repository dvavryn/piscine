Create a programm that takes a number as argument and converts
it to its written letters value.

Executable name: rush-02

Your source code will be compiled as follows:
	make fclean
	make

Your program can take up to 2 arguments:
	If there is only one argument, it is the value you need
	to convert.
	If there are two arguments, the first argument is the
	new reference dictionary and the second argument is
	the value you need to convert.

If the argument isn't a positive number, your program must return "Error, followed by a newline

Your program should go beyond unsigned int.

Your program must parse the dictionary given as a resource
to the project. The values inside it must be used to print
the result. There values can be modified.

Any memory allocated on the heap (wieh malloc(3)) must be
freed correctly. This will be verified during evaluation.

The dictionary will have the folloewing rules:
	[a number][0 to n spaces]:[0 to n spaces][any printable characters\n]
	Numbers are to be handled the same way atoi handels them.
	You will trim the spaces before and after the value in
	the dictionary.
	The dictionary will always have at least the keys as in the
	reference dictionary.
	Their Value can be modified, more entries can be added,
	but the initial keys can't be removed.
	You only need to use the initial entries(For instance, if
	we add 54:  fifty-four, you still have to use 50:  fifty
	and 4:  four)
	The entries of the dictionary can be stores in any order.
	There can be empty lines in the dictionary.
	If you have any errors from the dictionary parsing, your
	program must output "Dict Error\n"
	If the dictionary doesn't allow you to resolve the asked value, your program must output "Dict Error\n"

Example:
	$> ./rush-02 42 | cat -e
	forty two$
	$> ./rush-02 0 | cat -e
	zero$
	$> ./rush-02 10.4 | cat -e
	Error$
	$> ./rush-02 100000 | cat -e
	one hundred thousand$
	$> grep "20" numbers.dict | cat -e
	20 : hey everybody !$
	$> ./rush-02 20 | cat -e
	hey everybody !$
	5
